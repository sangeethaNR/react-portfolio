      <p>
      I'm an ex-software developer trying to start back my career.I have past experience working as
                            a developer.
                            I love being a web developer beacuse I like development.I like to work with HTML/CSS.I like
                            the flexibility to use addons and pluging to make
                            look websites good.It is always a fun to create a interactive web page. we can extend our
                            ideas and creativity as a web developer.
                            The best part is I can build something and I can see the resuts immediately.I have sample
                            projects displayed in the 'Project' section.Click on each image for detailed view.
